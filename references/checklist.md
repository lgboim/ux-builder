- [ ] Platform conventions and industry standards followed (Jakob's Law)
- [ ] Irrelevant information removed from checkout/key flows (Aesthetic & Minimalist Design)
- [ ] Users can always undo or cancel key actions (User Control & Freedom)
- [ ] System provides appropriate feedback within reasonable time (Visibility of System Status)
- [ ] Descriptions are specific, not generic (e.g., "Very good breakfast" not "Breakfast included")
- [ ] Desktop hamburger menus are absent
- [ ] Specific small details included in product/service descriptions (increase confidence)
